# Technicalities
Technicalities is a Minecraft mod that attempts to innovate in all aspects of modding, be it in terms of coding techniques, art style or gameplay features.

The idea of such a mod first appeared in early 2011, when Amadornes started making mods, and has since then evolved in many different ways, to the point of having been abandoned for well over 4 years and picked up again to start again under this new name. In that time the idea has been matured, influenced by both innovations in the modding world and in real life and it has evolved in many ways to be what it is now.
